          Welcome to the help page for <span class="light-blue">Join</span>,
          your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll
          provide an overview of what <span class="light-blue">Join</span> is,
          how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="light-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
          management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
          part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <span class="light-blue">Join</span> leverages
          the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
          in an intuitive, visual interface.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is important to note that <span class="light-blue">Join</span> is
          designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
          business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
          experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability,

        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
          <span class="light-blue">Join</span>:
        </p>
        <br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="nr">1.</span></td>
            <td>
              <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p>
                When you log in to <span class="light-blue">Join</span>, you'll
                find a default board. This board represents your project and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="nr">2.</span></td>
            <td>
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>
                In <span class="light-blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="nr">3.</span></td>
            <td>
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="nr">4.</span></td>
            <td>
              <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
              <p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="nr">5.</span></td>
            <td>
              <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible.
              </p>

        <br />
        Remember that using <span class="light-blue">Join</span> effectively
        requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
        reflects the current state of your project.
